# Game Park framework documentation

Welcome to you, (future) developer!

If you love board games, and you would like to adapt one online, you have come to the right place :hugs:

## Get started

### Pick a game

We cannot host a board game on Game Park without an agreement with the publisher.
So, if you want your work to get online, please contact us before you start! <contact@game-park.com>

### Prerequisite

All you need to know is [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
:bulb: *You can find a lot of free resources online to learn this language.*

You need to install a code editor, such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/fr-fr/webstorm/).

You also need to install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/fr) to run the game on your computer,
and [Git](https://git-scm.com/), to save your code on [Game Park Github repository](https://github.com/gamepark).

### Prepare the repository

:warning: **We usually take care of this step for you.**

Open [Game Park Board Game Template](https://github.com/gamepark/board-game-template), and click "Use this template" to "Create a new repository".

Then, checkout the repository on your computer using Git, and search and replace in every file :
* Game Template => Name of your Game
* game-template => name-of-your-game

Finally, commit and push the changes using Git.
