## Get started

On [Game Park](https://game-park.com/), you can play board games online. **The rules are enforced**, so players can only play "by the rules".

We have a **modern framework** that helps us code new games with beautiful user interface **very efficiently**.

If you love board games, and you would like to adapt one online, you have come to the right place! :hugs:

## How can you start?

- We only publish games if we have the licence agreement: please get in touch with us on our [Discord dev server](https://discord.gg/MaWUjfdYjT) before you start coding!
- To learn how we adapt a game, go to the **[Step-by-step example](step-by-step-example/choose-a-game.md)**
- To understand how it works, go to the **[Concepts](concepts/TODO.md)**
