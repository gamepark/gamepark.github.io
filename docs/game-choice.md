# Choosing a game to implement on Game Park

We only host games for which we have an agreement with the publisher for the licence.

Please get in touch with us to choose a game we can host and sign an agreement!

As a developer, you can get 15% of the game revenues (based on active Game Park subscribers playing the game).

Of course, you can code any game you like just for fun, but we will not be able to help nor host it when you are done.
