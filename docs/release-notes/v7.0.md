# Release notes v7.0

**Release date:** December 2024

Version 7.0 is a major release that modernizes the entire framework stack. See the [Migration to v7](troubleshooting/v7-migration-guide.md) guide for step-by-step upgrade instructions.

## Dependencies upgrades

- **Lodash** replaced with **es-toolkit** (smaller bundles)
- **React 17** upgraded to **React 19**, **Redux 5**
- **Create React App** replaced with **Vite** (much faster dev server and hot reloading)
- **Yarn 1** replaced with **Yarn 4** (Berry)
- **TypeScript** and **Node.js** upgraded to latest versions (Node 22+)
- **Apollo Client** upgraded to **v4**

## Build & module system

- Libraries are now built as **ES modules** (no more CommonJS)
- The `/** @jsxImportSource @emotion/react */` line is no longer needed on files using Emotion CSS
- The `REACT_APP_` prefix on environment variables is removed (Vite uses `VITE_` instead)

## API changes

- New `keepActionSecret` API (replacing `keepMoveSecret`)

## Bugfixes

- Dice rolls fixes
- Animation fixes (`pauseNextConsequenceAnimation` to prevent simultaneous move conflicts)
- `usePlay` wrapped in `useCallback` to prevent infinite re-rendering
- Drag-and-drop performance: prevent all draggable material from re-rendering when a drop area is hovered
