# Release notes v7.1

## Views feature

A new **Views** feature has been added to the rules API, allowing games to define multiple visual representations of the game state.

## New locators

- **`PlaceholderLocator`**: display placeholder items for different game views
- **`DelegateLocator`**: delegate positioning to another locator based on the current view

## Locator origin

Locators now support an **origin** property, allowing more flexible item positioning relative to a reference point.
