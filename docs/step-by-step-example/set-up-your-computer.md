# Set up your computer

## What you need to know - or learn

### Programming language

We use [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to code the games.

Typescript is like [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), but with types. Types are incredibly useful, it helps detect a lot of nasty bugs earlier during the development.

It is perfectly possible to code a game on Game Park without any prior knowledge. It is actually a great way to practice when you learn.

:bulb: If you are a new developer, you can take any quick online course about Javascript, then about Typescript, to be good to go!

### Web app framework

We use [React](https://react.dev/) to display the games.

As our framework takes care of nearly everything here, **you do not need to learn React** to start coding a game.

## What you need to install

### NodeJS

You need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/fr) to run Typescript/Javascript programs on your computer.

### Any code editor

You need to install a code editor, such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/fr-fr/webstorm/).

### Git: version control

We host the code of our games on [GitHub](https://github.com/gamepark).

You need to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to be able to check out the project and save you code.

### Yarn: package and project manager

You need to install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to install the project dependencies, test your code, and deploy.
