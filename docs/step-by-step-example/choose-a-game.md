As a developer, you can get 15% of the game revenues (based on active Game Park subscribers playing the game).

Of course, you can code any game you like just for fun, but we will not be able to help nor host it when you are done.

## Follow the rules!

The rules of the game (in English if available) must be your bible to name everything in the code.

**Stay as close as possible with the terms used in the rules.**

## The examples

A lot of open source examples are available on Game Park's GitHub: https://github.com/gamepark
(older games may not be public because they are implemented with an older version of the framework)
