As a developer, you can get 15% of the game revenues (based on active Game Park subscribers playing the game).

Of course, you can code any game you like just for fun, but we will not be able to help nor host it when you are done.

## The example: Colt Super Express

We will showcase the framework using the implementation of Colt Super Express.

Colt Super Express is a simple game, and a very good example for most features that we frequently need to adapt other games.
