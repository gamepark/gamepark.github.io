# Identify the material

A board game is all about Boards, Cards, Tokens... moving around the table.

The types of material are listed in [/rules/src/material/MaterialType.ts](https://github.com/gamepark/colt-super-express/blob/main/rules/src/material/MaterialType.ts)

We follow the terms from the rules:

<img width="282" src="./_media/material-types-2.jpg"/>

In Colt Super Express, we choose to group the "Locomotive card" and the "Train car card" into a single type: "Train card".

The reason is that those cards share the same location (the train line), so it is simpler to use the same material type here.
