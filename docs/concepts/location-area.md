# Location area

2 items share the same location area when they have the same:
- location type
- location parent
- location player
- location id

The location area concept is used:
- For [Location Strategies](features/location-strategies.md) (strategies apply to the items that share the same location area).
- For [Navigation arrows](step-by-step-example/help-dialogs.md#the-navigation-buttons) inside the material help dialogs.
- For displaying the proper quantity on tooltip inside [MoneyDescription](features/items-with-quantity.md#money).
